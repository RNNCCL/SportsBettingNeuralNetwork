# SportsBettingNeuralNetwork
This project is not longer under active development, but a python version is planned based on sklearn and tensorflow with the inclusion of non-odds data. The project was developed in Matlab and uses their machine learning module to fit neural network to odds data from a number of bookmakers in an attempt to predict results. 

## Project Status
The project was abandoned when I concluded that odds data was insufficient to predict better than random chance the outcomes of sports event. I plan to continue the project in future in python using sklearn and tensorflow but coupled with a web scraping module to provide a wider range of non-odds data. 

## Input Data
The program was developed using the data from http://www.football-data.co.uk/data.php and http://www.racing-bet-data.com/.
